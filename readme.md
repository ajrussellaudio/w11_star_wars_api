# Week 11 Weekend Homework

This is a very simple program which queries the [Star Wars API](http://swapi.co/) for data on the characters of the movies. It then displays each character's height and weight, and calculates their BMI.

It would then have created a Highcharts bar chart from the data, but I ran out of time after fighting with the API all weekend.
